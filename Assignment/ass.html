<p>Bruges, Belgium is the most picturesque city of Old Flanders. Wonder at medieval rooftops that step up to the sky, a history that spans back to the Vikings, and canals that credit the city as one of Europe’s “Venice of the North,” – the enjoyment expands to every sense.</p>
<p>Rome is known for its stunning architecture, with the Colleseum, Pantheon, and Trevi Fountain as the main attractions. It was the center of the Roman Empire that ruled the European Continent for several ages.</p>
<p>Amsterdam is famous for a lot of things: the beautiful historic buildings, the rijksmuseum, the canals, the Anne Frank house, the red light district and of course because of their freespiritness and tons of coffeeshops or just random shops that sell cannabis</p>
